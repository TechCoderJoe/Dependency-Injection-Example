# Dependency-Injection-Example

This project explains Dependency Injection (DI) using an example of a GUID service.

## Prerequisits
.NET 8.0

## Benefits of DI:

* Loose coupling
* Improved testability
* Increased flexibility

## Scopes in DI:

* Transient: New instance per request
* Scoped: Single instance per request/operation
* Singleton: Single instance for entire application

## Key Takeaways:

* DI manages object lifecycles and dependencies.
* Choose the scope based on how long an object needs to exist.
* DI promotes better code organization, testability, and maintainability.
